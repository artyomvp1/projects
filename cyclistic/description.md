# About the project:
*This is my 4th project related to data analytics. In every new project I try to push myself to discover and try new approaches and methods. In this particular project I was focused on using Seaborn along with standart Python libraries. I am very happy with the amount of complex calculations I did during the analysis. I think I managed to answer all the questions that were initially set up.*

* [Original code](cyclistic.ipynb)

# Known problems:
* Hardcoding in the sections 4.2 - 4.5
* Not working with subplots
* Using for-loops instead of pandas tools
*
