    "# Introduction\n",
    "In 2016, Cyclistic launched a successful bike-share offering. Since then, the program has grown to a fleet of 5,824 bicycles that are geotracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the system anytime.\n",
    "\n",
    "Until now, Cyclistic’s marketing strategy relied on building general awareness and appealing to broad consumer segments. One approach that helped make these things possible was the flexibility of its pricing plans: single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders. Customers who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members."

    " **Lily Moreno** : The director of marketing and your manager. Moreno is responsible for the development of campaigns and initiatives to promote the bike-share program. These may include email, social media, and other channels.  \n",
    " **Cyclistic marketing analytics team** : A team of data analysts who are responsible for collecting, analyzing, and reporting data that helps guide Cyclistic marketing strategy. You joined this team six months ago and have been busy learning about Cyclistic’s mission and business goals — as well as how you, as a junior data analyst, can help Cyclistic achieve them.  \n",
    " **Cyclistic executive team** : The notoriously detail-oriented executive team will decide whether to approve the recommended marketing program.  \n",

    "1. How annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?\n",
    "2. Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual membership?\n",
    "3. How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?"
